# TermChat

Integrated A.I Chatbot inside the terminal. Programmed entirely in C.

## Prerequisites

Make sure these are installed for the project to run:

- Linux environment
- OpenAI API-key

For developers you also need the following:

- GNU Make >= 4.4.1
- clang >= 19.1.7

## Usage

Create this configuration file `~/.config/termchatrc.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4.1",
  "role": "developer",
  "instruction": "Professional C Programmer",
  "openai": "<API-Key Here>"
}
```

After this is done, run the binary like this:

```bash
./termchat "Who created the C programming language?"
```

You will get a response looking like this:

```bash
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|gpt-4.1                                                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|The C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s.|
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## Development

Simply clone or fork the project then run the following
command to update dependencies and compile:

```bash
make build
```

A new folder `build` will be generated in the root of the project.

```bash
ðŸ“‚ /
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ build
    â””â”€â”€ out
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ include
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ src
â””â”€â”€ ...
```
